GLOSSARY

Transaction ledger - The blockchain

The bitcoin protocol stack is open source and the protcol communicated via the internet.

HISTORY

2008 - white paper released by satoshi nakaomoto
2009 - bitcoin network started

CLIENTS

 - Full Index Node (controls full protocol and holds backup of all transaction)
 - Light (controls wallets, relies on servers for tranasction and network)
 - Web (Holds nothing, acts as api to servers for protocols) - use GRPC API to gather unspent transactions

TRUSTED TRANSACTION

Blockchain explorer - Search engine for tranas using an address

Tranasctions are made from inputs that contain the prev tranasction which was encumbered
The output will be encumbered by using the receivers pub key so that only they can use it via signature

An output will contain change back to the sender if the input doesnt match the payment amount
Inputs are combined and can be to multiple outputs if required

When sent to the network all nodes (in the peer-peer network) will forward to other nodes any transaction the recieve, within a few seconds the client will recieve from the send the transaction

Clients can be confident if the transaction uses unspent prev transaction and enough transaction fee to be mined

Output != Input //Delta is transaction fee

When a new block is mined the fingerprint of the previous block is used 
When the solution is found the transaction is added to the blockchain
After 6 Blocks ontop considered trusted (irrevocable) and irreverable due to comp required for reversal

Full client will check entire transaction history back to mined coin
Light client will be based on check if its in the blockchain and has blocks ontop
